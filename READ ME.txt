This compressed folder contains 3 folders: "ip_repo", "parvez_ro_during" and "parvez_ro_prepost"

"ip_repo"
1. Contains many IPs out of which only 3 are important: "AXI_BIT_1.0", "AXI_BTI_2_1.0" and "AXI_RO_1.0"
	a. "AXI_RO_1.0": IP for normal ROs
	b. "AXI_BTI_1.0": IP for open loop chain of inverters with input of 1st stage being low.
	c. "AXI_BTI_2_1.0": IP for open loop chain of inverters with input of 1st stage being high.

"parvez_ro_prepost"
1. Vivado project for measuring frequency of all the ROs (including the only_BTI stress ckts which are normal ROs for this project)
2. RO0, RO3 and RO4 in the block design are normal ROs.
3. RO1 and RO2 are also normal ROs for frequency measurement only. When we move onto the "parvez_ro_during"
   these RO1 and RO2 get replaced with BTI0 and BTI1 circuits. That's why if you see the constraints files
   for RO1 and RO2 LUTs, you'll find their locations to be exactly same as of the BTI0 and BTI1 circuits.
4. When you open the project on your system, the IP repository location needs to be modified to the its new location.

"parvez_ro_during"
1. Vivado project for measuring frequency of all the ROs (excluding the only_BTI stress ckts which are open loop chain of inverters)
2. RO0, RO3 and RO4 in the block design are normal ROs.
3. BTI0 and BTI1 have the taken the place of RO1 and RO2 (from "parvez_ro_prepost project).
4. BTI0 and BTI1 won't be oscillating during the stress.
5. When you open the project on your system, the IP repository location needs to be modified to the its new location.

**Note: BTI0 and BTI1 are NOT BTI sensors. They are just open loop chain of inverters with a constant input voltage of 0 and 1, respectively.
